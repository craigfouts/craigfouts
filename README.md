### Hello :) 

I am a computational scientist / mathematician with a passion for probabilistic inference and emergent behavior in the context of biomedical data.

Currently, I work as an associate computational biologist in the New York Genome Center's Technology Innovation Laboratory, where I develop statistical models and build machine learning tools for genomics research. I also collaborate as a visiting researcher with the Computational Morphogenomics Group at Columbia University, as well as occasionally with the Self-Organizing Systems Group at Google Research. 

Outside of research, I enjoy inline skating, skiing, scuba diving, playing the lyre harp, and building cool stuff.
